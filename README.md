work in progress library to parse and render data from XFL/FLA files.

this is a passion project and there's no guarantee it will ever be fully functional.

shoutouts to [`xfl` by `andreasdr`](https://github.com/andreasdr/xfl), very cool although outdated library that does pretty much the same thing. it has helped a lot with figuring out how to parse some things.

i'd like to add the following features:
- exporting spritesheets from xfl data without the need for flash.
- possibly allow writing and modifying the data (im not sure if im legally allowed to do this though ...!)
