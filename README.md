work in progress library to parse and render data from XFL/FLA files.

this is a passion project and there's no guarantee it will ever be fully functional.

i'd like to add the following features:
- exporting spritesheets from xfl data without the need for flash.
- possibly allow writing and modifying the data (im not sure if im legally allowed to do this though ...!)
